# Modeling_Hearing_Aids 

Hearing aids can be quite the investment. I have relatives who utilize hearing aids and their hearing aids have become an integral part of their everyday lives. 

In this project, I decided to research hearing aids to learn more about aid features and what influences styles/pricing.

Essentially, one of my main questions is - What predictors define a hearing aid style?

In this project, I used a dataset I compiled consisting of hearing aid models and their features using the sites ZipHearing, HearingTracker, and hearing aid contracts (sources cited in report below).

A generalized logit model for nominal response was used in both SAS and R languages.
