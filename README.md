# Modeling_Hearing_Aids 

Hearing aids can be quite the investment. I have relatives who utilize hearing aids
and their hearing aids have become an integral part of their everyday lives. 

In this project I decided to research hearing aid styles as well as their prices to learn more about
aid features and how they are significant in determining a hearing aid style.

One of my focuses is to compare over-the-counter hearing aids to those that can only be
acquired through prescription or verified in-person vendors.

Essentially, one of my main questions is - What predictors define a hearing aid style?

In this project, I used a dataset I compiled consisting of hearing aid models and their features. 
A generalized logit model for nominal response was used in both SAS and R languages.

I compiled my dataset using ZipHearing, HearingTracker, and hearing aid contracts (sources cited in report below).
